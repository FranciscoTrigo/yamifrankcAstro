You probably have noticed it too. For a long time now many apps have replaced the old style scrollbars with thin
ones that are hard to see. Sometimes the scroll bar only appears while you are scrolling and sometimes its not there at all!  
I believe this probably started around the time Material Design came out, and the fact that so many people use mobile devices as their 
only computing device does not help (the scrollbar taks es precious horizontal screen space, after all).  

## Small fix on Windows 11

I've been using exclusively Windows lately due to my job. On it I fixed the issue by going to `Accessibility settings -> Visual effects`
and enabling `Always show scrollbars`.  
This made the scrollbar thicker and always visible on Firefox (which its the main inspirtation of this post.)
