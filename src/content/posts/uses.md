This is a non-extensive list of stuff that I use.
I took the idea from a bunch of other people that have this on their personal websites.

## Main computing

I have two main computers. A custom built desktop from a few years back (its called Venusaur, you can see more information below), and a Framework 16 laptop (called anomalocaris).

<summary>Venusaur</summary>

Venusaur was built in early 2021, but in reality I started purchasing components in mid or late 2020, some of them took a long time to get, specially the RTX 3090. 

- AMD Ryzen 5950
- Nvidia RTX 3090
- 64GB Ram
