I recently became a **Red Hat Certified Specialist in Containers** as part of my preparation for a future project, the exam was paid for
by my employer.

I'm going to talk about my experience studying for the certification and taking the exam, I hope it can help anybody else taking it in the future.  

## Study sources

### Red Hat Partner Learning Portal

Like I mentioned before, this certification was paid for by my employeer, and because we are a Red Hat Partner, I have access to their vast learning and course library.
I have to say, their courses are very good. For this certification I took DO188, which is not too long and can be completed in a couple of days.  

It does a good job explaining what containers are and how they are used, as well as their quirks and options. The best part is that the course is full of hands-on labs that
100% percent mirror what you will find in the real test.


### Other sources

I tried looking for other sources, just for the sake of having variety. But I could not find much material, at least compared to what you can find for other more popular
certifications like anything from CompTIA or AWS.  

Most of what I was able to find where some (badly) produced Youtube videos. I ended up not using any.

## The exam

### Registering for the exam

My boss registered me and paid for my exam. All I had to do was to schedule the exam from the link that I got in my email.  
I believe the cost of the exam is around $400 USD.  
The registration process is very standard, you choose which format you want (in-person at a testing center, or remote), you also select your time-zone and the time and date of your email.
Something strange that I noticed is that it did not have many time slots available, this is compared to other vendor's exams that had pretty much 24/7 availability.

### Taking the exam

Taking this exam was very interesting. Red Hat provides you with a bootable ISO that you must use for taking any exam. This allows them to have total control over the OS environment.  
You are also not allowed to use wireless mice and keyboards. And you must use an external webcam if you are doing the exam from a laptop.

I have taken many online proctored exams in the past, and this one is by far the strictest.
