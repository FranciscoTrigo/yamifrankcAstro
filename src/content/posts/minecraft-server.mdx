A couple of years ago I selhosted a Minecraft server on my own hardware. It was called Cubinacion and it
was intended to be used by a friend of mine and me during Twitch streams.  
The setup was really fun, I loved experimenting with server mods and pluggins and configurations. But in reality we only
used it for about a month. After that initial rush everybody stopped joining and I killed it after a couple of months.

I recently created another one. Now I hosted it on Leafpad. Its for my cousins to play. But they dont use it anyway.
