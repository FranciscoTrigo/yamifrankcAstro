## First encounter with Minecraft

The first time I played Minecraft was around 2010, I remember somebody shared a link with me to play it. 
I think it was a pretty new game back then, at this point you could play it from a web browser!
I liked the game and hung around with friends, but did not become a super fan.  
After that I stopped playing for a long time.

## Second encounter

My real second encounter with it was back in 2020 when Level1 Techs created a server for the holiday season.  
I played there for hours almost every night and made some good friends.  
This time I really liked the game, but for me the best part was the interaction between players.

## My first server: Cubinacion

A couple of months after that, I started selfhosting a server while I was still very hyped about Minecraft.
I hosted it on my Proxmox box and used Cloudflare to open it to the world.  
The purpose of the server was mainly to use it while a friend and I streamed on Twitch. It was ver fun at the start, I loved
the administration and configuration part of it (I would spend hours looking at plugins).  
The server was quite active during the first few days, but in reality we only
used it for about a month. After that initial rush everybody stopped joining and I killed it after a while. 


## Second attempt: Chetumal

A couple of months ago I started playing a Bedrock world with my girlfriend and her cousins. Its a lot of fun!
But the problem with it (for me, at least), is that since the world is saved on my girlfriend's Xbox, her cousins and I can only
join the world when she opens it for us. This was specially inconvenient when the cousins wanted to play and we weren't home 
or were doing something else.  
So I thought of a solution, creating a server!  

Around this time I found out about [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/). It is a Java Server plugin that allows Bedrock players to join Java servers.
Perfect! This way the server can be joined with the Java client (me and all my friends preffer it), and the cousins can join with their devices (everything from the Nintendo Switch to an old phone).
  
I created a server on [Lilipad.gg](https://lilypad.gg/), it looked good and the price is not to expensive. I quickly enabled GeyserMC and set the server up.  

Time to play!  

Except... it did not work. The cousins were able to join, but apparently they had lots of lag and bugs. Unplayable! They said.
It works fine for me and my Java friends, so that is good.

The server is very inactive. My friends created a house and that is about it.  
I may kill it again, but you can join it if you want! Go to the [links](https://yamifrankc.com/posts/links) page to find how.
