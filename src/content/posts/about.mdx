My name is YamiFrankc and this is my website/blog.  I created it just to have some fun posting online and away from most social media. 
This site is about everything that I like or feel interested about, so you will mainly find stuff about technology, videogames or about the internet. But also some other random stuff.

I've had an internet presence and created websited in one way or another since I was 10 years old, I've had a bunch of short-lived blogs and also administered a couple of forums (Popokemon was the most succesful one, over 200 registered users!

Some of my interests are home labs, playing guitar, technology and video games. Also Digimon and One Piece.
