I recently started working as a consultant at a small consultancy company, where I have taken on projects using Red Hat technologies.  

I am also learning how to use Astro as I build this site, my other blog is using Hugo and I will probably convert it into an Astro site when I have some free time.

Lately I have been playing Mario Kart 8 and Mario Party Jamboree with friends, and I also watch my fiancee play Animal Crossing.  
And I have been watching Nana with my fiancee, too.
