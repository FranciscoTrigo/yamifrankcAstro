## 2025-12-19

I am (trying to) return to NixOS and Doom Emacs.

I had NixOS installed on my Framework laptop for a long time, but I have just been booting into Windows. I am now booting into NixOS and doing modifications to my config little by little when I have some free time.

As for Doom Emacs, I use it mostly only for Org-mode, I want it to replace Obsidian. This is not the first time I try, once or twice a year I get super excited about it and then dive head first into configs and stuff. Hopefully it stays this time. In the past the main issue has been cross-platform compability, meaning Android and Windows.

### 2025-10-31

I'm employed again, at a place and position that I worked before. Its not ideal, but much better than having no job.
Its an on-site desktop support job, so I'm back to going to the office 5 days a week, at least its not the morning shift :P.

Married life is going well, I like it.

I played a bit of the new Donkey Kong Bananza, I like it. My wife has been playing mostly, tho.
I also played the demo for the new Digimon Time Stranger game (on my Steam Deck!), it was cool. I want to buy the game but will wait until its on sale.

We got a chameleon gecko! We called her Watechen. And we put it in a bio active vivarium. It is still growing.

I have been unemployed for a while, got laif off two months ago. Honestly, it was a very stresful job and it was both a relief and a burden to stop working there. I have been interviewing but currently searching for jobs.

I got married! And "moved out" to a "department room" in my parents' house. Getting used to the married life and all the changes it brings.

I got a Switch 2 on launch day, and I really enjoyed playing Mario Kart World with my wife, sister and siblings in law.
Still playing lots of Minecraft.

And I also started watching Breaking bad.

### No date

I recently started working as a consultant at a small consultancy company, where I have taken on projects using Red Hat technologies such as Openshift or Keycloak. Its very interesting, and I get to learn a lot of new stuff.

I am also learning how to use Astro as I build this site, my other blog is using Hugo and I will probably convert it into an Astro site when I have some free time.

Also trying to use Emac's Org-mode again, instead of Obsidian. I think it is great but hard to use in the sense that it has so many features it gives me configuration paralysis! But I am making advancements. I've actually gotten to a point where I am happy with my config and have an idea of what I want.

Lately I have been playing Mario Kart 8 and Mario Party Jamboree with friends, and I also watch my fiancee play Stardew Valley.
And I have been watching Lo que la vida me robo  with my fiancee, too.
