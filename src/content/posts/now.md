## 2025-08-10

I have been unemployed for a while, got laif off two months ago. Honestly, it was a very stresful job and it was both a relief and a burden to stop working there. I have been interviewing but currently searching for jobs.

I got married! And "moved out" to a "department room" in my parents' house. Getting used to the married life and all the changes it brings.

I got a Switch 2 on launch day, and I really enjoyed playing Mario Kart World with my wife, sister and siblings in law.
Still playing lots of Minecraft.

And I also started watching Breaking bad.

I recently started working as a consultant at a small consultancy company, where I have taken on projects using Red Hat technologies such as Openshift or Keycloak. Its very interesting, and I get to learn a lot of new stuff.

I am also learning how to use Astro as I build this site, my other blog is using Hugo and I will probably convert it into an Astro site when I have some free time.

Also trying to use Emac's Org-mode again, instead of Obsidian. I think it is great but hard to use in the sense that it has so many features it gives me configuration paralysis! But I am making advancements. I've actually gotten to a point where I am happy with my config and have an idea of what I want.

Lately I have been playing Mario Kart 8 and Mario Party Jamboree with friends, and I also watch my fiancee play Stardew Valley.
And I have been watching Lo que la vida me robo  with my fiancee, too.
